I have completed Part A of the multipart Programming Languages course.

As I went through everything and reading others comments on the course, I must say some doubts have crept into my mind that I am a complete and utter moron, but for those in the same boat as me, that's fine.

After I'd say a few years of programming mostly in Imperative languages (Java, Python, C#), your brain gets used to the way logic **flows** in a way, this made me understand the concept being presented to me i.e. closures and how it related to lexical scoping and so on so forth, but, when it came to reading code and implementing it was another story all together.

I was quite honestly struggling with the way you need to think about solving an issue when it came to Functional Programming, I could do it but once `NONE` and `SOME` came into play, my code suddenly became messy and boy that gave me quite the lack of confidence in my abilities a a software developer. What didn't help was the esoteric nature of SML as a language and very poor documentation and you have a recipe for disaster.

However I do concede that some of the fault lies with me as well, since the longer it went on the more I just wanted to get the damn thing finished and so my concentration went out the window, this resulted in me getting a poor 54% on the exam. And because of this I know I need to take some damn responsibility and practise, practise, practise...just not with SML.

I am moving forward learning the functional programming paradigm with OCaml, a ML based language with more support and better documentation. (no offence)

My Journey with functional programming is far from over...it's just the beginning, or until I discover sniffin coke is a better way to send me to rehab...
